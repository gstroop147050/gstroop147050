										<h2>About Our Troop</h2>
										<p>Meetings weekly, Fridays 4pm - 6pm at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Linkwood%20Park%203699%20Norris%20Dr%2C%20Houston%2C%20TX%2077025">Linkwood Park and Community Center</a></p>

									<h3>Where are troop meetings?</h3>
									<p>We meet at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=Linkwood%20Park%203699%20Norris%20Dr%2C%20Houston%2C%20TX%2077025">Linkwood Park and Community Center</a> on Friday afternoons from 4pm - 6pm. <b>Meetings will be mostly outdoors.</b> There is also a room inside the community center for our use. Restrooms and water fountains are available inside the community center</p>
									
									<h3>Who can join?</h3>
									<p>Our troop is open to <i><b>all</i> girls in 1st - 3rd grade.</b> Girl Scouts is <b>inclusive</b> and "ask(s) for all Girl Scouts—girls, volunteers, alums, supporters, families, staff, and our suppliers and service providers—to commit to taking action to make the world a more equitable place". <b>We are a multi-school troop and welcome children from all schools</b></p>
									<p>"Now more than ever, we have to stand together as one people, one nation—regardless of our opinions, race, religion or beliefs, gender, who we love, what language we speak, or where we come from,” says Girl Scouts’ developmental psychologist, Dr. Andrea Bastiani Archibald. “But unity doesn’t mean abandoning the things that make us different from one another, and it doesn’t mean standing by or looking the other way in the face of bigotry and hatred. <b>Real unity is what you get when a lot of very diverse people come together to form one complex yet seamless whole. It’s about equality, inclusiveness, and dignity—values I think we as parents all hope to instill in our children.</b>” <a href="https://www.girlscouts.org/en/discover/about-us/diversity-equity-inclusion-racial-justice.html">Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Racial Justice</a>  --- <a href="https://www.girlscouts.org/en/raising-girls/leadership/life-skills/diversity-and-inclusion-in-america.html">DEI in America</a></p>

									<h3>Why join Troop 147050?</h3>
									<p>We are fun, diverse, and priortize getting girls outdoors! “<b>Despite the known benefits of spending quality time outside, youth are becoming increasingly sedentary and disconnected from nature. Long school hours, reduced school recess periods, and the ever-increasing popularity of tech-based leisure activities like video games are all factors—but Girl Scouts’ outdoor programming, which spans a girl’s childhood and adolescence, offers girls another way.</b> … The number and variety of activities available through Girl Scouts lets girls participate in outdoor activities on a regular basis, and they do—even more than non–Girl Scouts who are also highly engaged. This is significant because frequency of participation in outdoor activities is found to positively correlate with the expression of challenge-seeking and problem-solving skills.” <a href="https://www.girlscouts.org/content/dam/girlscouts-gsusa/forms-and-documents/about-girl-scouts/research/GSRI_four-ways-Girl-Scouts-builds-girl-leaders-in-the-outdoors_0419.pdf">Four Ways Girl Scouts Builds Leaders in the Outdoors</a></p>

									<h3>What will my child do in your Girl Scout troop?</h3>
									<p>Girl Scouts offers girls many <b>opportunities to learn by doing in all-girl, informal, out-of-school-time settings</b> in which they can feel comfortable trying new things and taking safe, supervised risks. <a href="http://www.girlscouts.org/content/dam/girlscouts-gsusa/forms-and-documents/about-girl-scouts/research/White%20Paper_Volunteers%20Can%20Do%20it.pdf"> Volunteers Can Do It! White Paper</a></p>
									<p>Girl Scouts is <b>girl-led</b> so the activities will be determined by the troop, themselves! Our troop is active in the outdoors and we will spend most of our time outside. 
										
										“Hand-in-hand with adult volunteers—often parents or caregivers—<b>girls select exciting hands-on activities and projects, try new things, and cheer each other on.</b> Together, they earn badges to reflect their successes and show the world what they’re made of.” <a href="https://www.gsema.org/content/dam/girlscoutseasternmass-redesign/documents/recruitment/gsema-all-about-girl-scouts.pdf">  What is Girl Scouts</a>
</p>

									<p>“<b>Girl-led means the girls should be in control of all aspects of their Girl Scout experience.</b> We know this sometimes results in a less than organized and time-consuming experience, but that’s okay. Girls need to be able to learn in a safe environment! We also know that girls of different age levels are capable of different levels of leadership. That is where progression comes in. Progression enables girls to acquire the necessary skills to become competent leaders. They start at one level and practice the skills they need to get to the next level. As girls progress towards higher levels of complexity and difficulty, they’ll also take on more and more responsibilities." <a href="https://www.girlscoutsla.org/content/dam/girlscoutsla-redesign/documents/volunteer-training/Short-Snappy-Girl-Led-Progression.pdf">Girl-Led Progression</a>

										<p> For the 2025–2026 <b>Girl Scout membership year dues are $45 for girls and $30 for adults</b>. "Nothing should stand in the way of a girl reaching her full leadership potential through Girl Scouting. That’s why our council’s financial aid program is dedicated to removing financial barriers, ensuring that every girl has access to our leadership development opportunities.<b>Girls and volunteers can apply for financial aid to help cover the cost of membership, uniforms, and program registration fees.</b> In fact, nearly half of our members participate in Girl Scouting with the support of some form of financial assistance.” <a href="https://www.gssjc.org/en/members/for-parents-and-families/financial-aid.html">Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Financial Aid</a>
